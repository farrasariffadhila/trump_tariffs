Unfortunately the tariff issue caused a large shift in the polls in favour of the Liberals. It would have been nice if Trump could have waited until after our federal election to announce tariffs.,1899240267170869650,,ksorbs,en,,0,0,0,https://x.com/nowoolovreyz/status/1899240267170869650,969376788525830146,nowoolovreyz

Canada has restrictive tariffs and quotas that harm American business and American workers.

To this day the US dairy has never met that quota so they have never had to pay tariffs. Perhaps research before you believe anything Trump or MAGA says,1899240171796656341,,itsmeJessicaP16,en,,0,0,0,https://x.com/RichardJuly72/status/1899240171796656341,760593019779227648,RichardJuly72
